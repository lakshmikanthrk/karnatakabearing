				<p>Needle Roller Bearing is a special type of roller bearing which uses long, thin cylindrical roller resembling needles. Ordinary roller bearings' rollers are only slightly longer than their diameter, but needle bearings typically have rollers that are at least four times longer than their diameter bearings with cylindrical rollers that are small in diameter relative to their length. The modified roller/raceway profile prevents stress peaks to extend bearing service life.</p>
				<p>Compared to ball bearings and ordinary roller bearings, needle bearings have a greater surface area in contact with the races, so they can support a greater load. They are also thinner, so they require less clearance between the axle and the surrounding structure.</p>
				<p>A lot of classification and characteristics when it comes to needle roller.</p>
				<p>Thrust Needle Roller Bearing</p>
				<p>This bearing comprises needle rollers or cylindrical rollers, a cage to guide and retain properly the rollers, and disc-shaped rolling bearing ring. This is a bearing capable of supporting one-way axial load. Furthermore, this bearing can be used without a rolling bearing ring, where the heat-treated and ground bearing mount surface can be used as the raceway surface. </p>
