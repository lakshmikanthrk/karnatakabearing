				<p>In Angular Contact Ball Bearings, the line of action of the load, at the contacts between balls and raceways, forms an angle with the bearings axis. The inner and outer rings are offset to each other and the bearings are particularly suitable for carrying combined radial and axial load. The axial load carrying capacity of angular contact ball bearings increases as the contact angle increases. The contact angle is defined as the angle between the line joining the points of contact of the ball and the raceways in the radial plane, along which the combined load is transmitted from one raceway to another, and a line perpendicular to the bearing axis.</p>
				<p>Angular contact ball bearings have inner and outer ring raceways that are displaced relative to each other in the direction of the bearing axis. This means that these bearings are designed to accommodate combined loads hence simultaneously acting radial and axial loads.</p>

				<h5>Single Row Angular Contact Ball Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	High Dynamic load carrying capacity<br>
					•	Reduced friction<br>
					•	Quiet Run<br> 
					•	High speed with low heat generation within bearing<br>
					•	High Operating life<br>
				</p>
				<p>Single Row Angular Contact Ball Bearings have single raceway grooves in the inner and outer rings that are relatively offset. These bearings can support axial loads in one direction only and are to adjust against another bearing if the axial load is coming from both the directions. Each bearing can be located endwise in one direction only.</p>
				<p>Single-row Angular Contact ball bearings can sustain the radial, axial or composite load, however, the axial load must be in one direction.</p>

				<h5>Double Row Angular Contact Ball Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	Lower Noise Levels<br>
					•	Reduced Friction<br>
					•	Improved Seals<br> 
					•	Less Lubrication consumption<br>
					•	Higher Cost Effective<br>
				</p>
				<p>Double Row Angular Contact Ball Bearings are units with solid inner and outer rings and ball and cage assemblies with polyamide or sheet steel cages. Their construction is similar to a pair of single row angular contact ball bearings in an O arrangement but they are narrower to a certain extent.</p>
				<p>This means that they are designed to accommodate and simultaneously action axial and radial loads. Due to angular contact, the axial load carrying capacity of angular contact ball bearings increases as the contact angle increases. The contact angle is defined as the angle between the line joining the points of contact of the ball and the raceways in the radial plane along which the load is transmitted from one raceway to another, and a line perpendicular to the bearing axis. These bearings can accommodate thrust in both directions. The chief advantages of the double row type are rigidity, compactness and high capacity.</p>
