				<p>Self-Aligning Ball Bearings have a double row of balls guided by a common sphered raceway in the outer ring and two deep uninterrupted raceway grooves in the inner ring and have the special feature of a continuous spherical outer ring raceway allowing the inner ring/ball complement to swivel within the outer ring. This is what enables a degree of self-alignment in the application.</p>
				<p>The bearings are insensitive to the angular misalignment of the shaft relative to the housing, therefore, this type of bearing is recommended when the alignment of the shaft and the housing (misalignment) are a problem and the shaft could deflect. Self-aligning ball bearings are most suitable for absorbing radial forces. </p>

				<p>A self-aligning bearing is recommended when the alignment of the shaft and housing is difficult or when the shaft may bend during operation, the bearing would be selected based on the load, speed and space constraints of the application. Also, the misalignment and/or shaft bending amount should be considered when specifying a bearing type.</p>
