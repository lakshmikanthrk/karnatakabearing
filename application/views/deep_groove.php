				<p>Deep Groove Ball Bearings are the most commonly used bearing in almost all sectors, hence most versatile and require basic operating circumstances. They are easy to embed with very low maintenance compared to the others. Their low torque makes them compatible with high speed. </p>
				<p>These types of bearings assist both radial and axial forces in both directions. These bearings have less friction and are reformed for reduced vibration and low noise with high rotational speed.  </p>

				<h5>Single Row Deep Grove Ball Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	Low torque with Great rotational speed<br>
					•	Cost Effective<br>
					•	Cheap maintenance<br> 
					•	Carry Radial and limited axial load
				</p>
				<p>Single Row Deep Groove Ball Bearings are characterized by having deep raceway grooves in which the inner and outer rings have circular arcs of slightly larger radius than that of the single line of balls placed within the cage. They also have non-separable rings. They can carry radial capacity with ease and can work with limited axial load making it the most versatile and cost economic while also providing with great rotational speed.</p>
				<p>They are available in rubber seals or steel shields with one or both sides of the bearing or even open at both sides of the ring. Easy to configure or assemble the bearing without any difficulty. They require well-aligned bearing mountings as there is a high degree of conformity between balls and raceways, the self-aligning capability of deep groove ball bearings is less.</p>
				<p>Single row deep groove ball bearings are versatile and are used in space applications, the balance between space and load applications and few heavy load applications.</p>

				<h5>Double Row Deep Grove Ball Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	Pair of single-row deep groove ball bearing for higher load<br>
					•	Low Noise<br>
					•	High temperature resistant<br> 
					•	Carry radial and axial load in both direction
				</p>
				<p>Double row deep groove ball bearing assembles with twin single row that has deep interrupted raceway and high conformity between ball and raceways. They are resistant to high temperatures.</p>
				<p>The slightly wider and carry heavier load when compared to single row deep groove bearing and are more efficient as they carry axial loads acting in both directions in addition to radial loads.</p>
