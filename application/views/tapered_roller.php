				<p>The Taper Roller Bearing is a separable type bearing which inner components (consists of rollers, cage, and inner ring) can be separated from the outer ring. Therefore, it can be very easily installed onto the journal and bearing housing.</p>
				<p>These bearings are commonly used for moderate speed, heavy-duty applications where durability is required such as machine tool spindles, rolling mills, mining equipment, metallurgy industry, plastics making machinery and other industries</p>
				<p>They are also customizable to match your specific speed, load, contamination, temperature or vibration conditions.</p>
				<p>Tapered roller bearings feature a cup and cone assembly. The cup is comprised of the outer ring and the cone assembly consists of an inner ring, rollers, and cage. This bearing construction accommodates combined loads and provides low friction during operation. By adjusting one single row tapered roller bearing against a second tapered roller bearing and applying a preload, a rigid bearing application can be achieved.</p>

				<h5>Single Row Tapered Roller Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	Rigid Bearing application<br>
					•	Separable and interchangeable<br>
					•	Enhanced operational reliability<br> 
					•	Low friction<br>
					•	Long service life
				</p>
				<p>Single Row Tapered Roller Bearing is the basic and the most widely used type of tapered roller bearing. It consists of the inner-ring assembly and the outer ring. It is usually fitted as one of an opposing pair. During equipment assembly, single-row bearings can be “set” to the required clearance (endplay) or preload condition to optimize performance.</p>
				<p>These are designed to accommodate combined loads, i.e. simultaneously acting radial and axial loads. The projection lines of the raceways meet at a common point on the bearing axis to provide a true rolling action and therefore low frictional moments during operation.</p>

				<h5>Double Row Tapered Roller Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	High load carrying capacity<br>
					•	High stiffness<br>
					•	Axial loads in both directions<br> 
					•	Low friction<br>
					•	Long service life
				</p>
				<p>Double Row Tapered Roller Bearing has a one-piece (double) outer ring and two single inner rings. It is usually supplied complete with an inner-ring spacer as a pre-set assembly. This configuration gives a wide effective bearing spread and is frequently chosen for applications where overturning moments are a significant load component. These bearings can be used in fixed (locating) positions or allowed to float in the housing bore. These outer rings have holes in the outer diameter that permit the use of pins to prevent outer ring rotation in the housing.</p>
				<p>Depending on the design, these bearings can accommodate heavy radial loads, axial loads in both directions and have a high degree of stiffness. Double row tapered roller bearings are typically used in gearboxes, hoisting equipment, rolling mills and machines in the mining industry.</p>

				<h5>Four Row Tapered Roller Bearing</h5>
				<p>•	Improved wear resistance<br>
					•	Improved sealing performance with less leakage and less frictional heat<br>
					•	Long service life<br> 
					•	Enhanced operational reliability<br>

				<p>Four Row Taper Roller Bearings are made up of two double row inner rings and two double row outer rings. These bearings are used for heavy load capacity as in the roller necks of rolling mills. The life of large bearings is extended by using case hardened steel, hollow rollers and pin-type cages. The life of large bearings is extended by using case hardened steel, hollow rollers and pin-type cages. These bearings can accommodate both radial and axial load at moderate speed. </p>
