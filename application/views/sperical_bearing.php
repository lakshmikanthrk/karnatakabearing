				<p>Spherical Roller Bearings are self-aligning bearings designed for heavy radial loading. They automatically compensate for large angular errors (shaft misalignments). They are usually of the double row design, both the rows of the rollers having common spherical raceways in the outer ring. </p>
				<p>This feature of this bearing has great practical importance in those cases where it is difficult to obtain exact parallelism between the shaft and housing both axes. So these bearings are suitable where misalignment can arise from mounting errors or from deflection of the shaft. They can take static as well as dynamic misalignment. Spherical roller bearings are particularly suitable for carrying heavy loads. They are commonly found in Industrial Gear boxes, Conveyors, Cement Grinding Rolls, Sugarcane crushers and passenger coach axle boxes of Railways.</p>
